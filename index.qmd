#### Start off NetSci 2026 with higher-order networks, data science, and new friends 

Hello and welcome! On **Sunday 5/31**, we the organizers in collaboration with NetSci 2026 will host a **hackathon on higher-order networks**. The purpose of this hackathon is to offer an energetic opener to the conference experience, develop skills in higher-order network analysis, and build connections between early-career researchers interested in this rich area of network science.

An example hypergraph, a data structure used to represent higher-order networks, [from the XGI package](https://xgi.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/tutorials/getting_started_2.html) for higher-order network analysis Python [@Landry_XGI_2023].

### The Mission

The hackathon will center around the recently-released *A Blue Start* dataset, which contains higher-order network data from the Bluesky social media platform [@smith_blue_2025]. In this data set, nodes are users and edges are *starter packs*—lists of accounts curated by individual users that can be followed en masse. Starter packs are an example of a higher-order network structure, as they connect between 8 and 150 users simultaneously. The data set contains over 2 million unique users and over 350,000 starter packs. The multiway nature of the data set allows us to ask richer questions than can be asked of pairwise networks; for example, there is a rich structure of overlap between different starter packs that cannot be captured by pairwise network analysis.

**The mission of the hackathon is to explore this rich data set using higher-order network analysis techniques to learn about the distinctive features of multiway user interactions on social media.**

A screencap from the organizers' meeting. 

:::

The hackathon will include: 

- Short talks and tutorials by experienced researchers in higher-order network science.
- Hands-on data analysis and coding sessions in small teams. 
- Social events for connecting with participants, organizers, and mentors. 
- A report-out to the larger NetSci conference during the lightning talk session. 




### More On The Data



The *A Blue Start* data set contains anonymized network data obtained from the Bluesky social media platform. Bluesky is a relatively new microblogging social media platform that spun out of Twitter in 2021; it uses the novel AT Protocol, which facilitates federated identities and allows users to store their data in portable repositories on personal data servers (PDSs) that log user actions  [@mccue_how_], [@blueskypbc_repository_2025]. In addition to offering affordances that are familiar to Twitter users, like following, posting content, and reposting, Bluesky also offers a feature called the *starter pack*, a list of accounts or feeds (which present content based on a custom curation algorithm) that are curated by an individual user @blueskypbc_introducing_2024. It is possible to follow all the entities in a starter pack by clicking one button; users are also able to peruse the list and selectively follow a subset of entities in the starter pack. Starter packs are higher-order networks: Bluesky allows users to add between 8 and 150 users to a starter pack, and it is also possible to convert arbitrarily large lists of users into starter packs programatically.
