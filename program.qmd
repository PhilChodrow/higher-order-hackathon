In this hackathon, we will hack in the highest-order way we can. Hacking in low-order ways is ***strongly discouraged***. The organizers and mentors will support participants in increasing the order of their hacking. 

Reseachers who instead choose to lower the order of their hacking will be politely asked to leave.

An outline of the schedule is the following:
